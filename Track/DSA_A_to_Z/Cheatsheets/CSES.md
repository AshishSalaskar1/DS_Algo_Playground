## üó∫Ô∏è Quick map
- üß≠ Sections: Introductory, Sorting/Searching, DP, Graphs, Range Queries
- üß∞ Classic templates: two pointers, prefix sums, DSU, BFS/DFS, segtree/Fenwick

## ‚úÖ Study checklist
- [ ] Recognize canonical pattern for each task
- [ ] Precompute where possible (prefix, powers, sieve)
- [ ] Off-by-one and 0/1-index conversions checked
