# LC-75 / Miscellaneous Cheatsheet

Pointers
- Keep canonical solutions for top LC-75 in Arrays/Strings/DP/Graphs
- Reuse templates from corresponding sheets here

## 🗺️ Quick map
- 🧩 Arrays/Strings, Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window
- 🌲 Trees/Graphs basics
- 🧮 DP & Prefix sums

## ✅ Study checklist
- [ ] Identify category quickly from constraints
- [ ] Choose template (window/stack/heap/DSU) before coding
- [ ] Time/space tradeoff noted (hashing vs two-pass)
