# Randomized Algorithms Cheatsheet

---

## 🗺️ Quick map
- 🎲 Randomized hashing (string/int)
- ⚖️ Randomized quickselect/quickSort
- 🚰 Reservoir sampling

## ✅ Study checklist
- [ ] Seeding and independence considerations
- [ ] Expected vs worst-case complexity noted
- [ ] Collision/variance risk mitigations (double hash, larger samples)

Techniques
- Randomized quickselect/quicksort pivot
- Reservoir sampling for streaming selection
- Monte Carlo vs Las Vegas distinctions

Hashing
- Pair with rolling/double hash for string problems
