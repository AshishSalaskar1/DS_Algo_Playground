# Codeforces Practice Cheatsheet

Tips
- Fast IO; avoid TLE via O(n log n) caps for 2e5
- Watch 1-based inputs; modulo and overflow in languages

Strategy
- Tag by topic; ladder by difficulty; upsolve with editorial notes into sheets here

## 🗺️ Quick map
- 🏷️ Tag mapping → go-to templates (two pointers, DSU, graphs, DP)
- ⚡ Fast IO and careful parsing
- 🧩 Edge cases and constructive proofs

## ✅ Study checklist
- [ ] Constraints → approach (O(n log n) vs O(n^2)?)
- [ ] Build minimal counterexamples for WA cases
- [ ] Re-run on samples after refactors; beware 1-based indices
