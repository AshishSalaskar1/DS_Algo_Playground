PROBLEM:
Accounts: 
   1. ["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],
   2. ["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],
   3. ["Mary","mary@mail.com"],
   4. ["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]
- Here names can be same. John in (1) and (4) is different, (1) and (2) is same
- You can merge two accounts IFF they have a email in common. (1) and (2) have johnsmith@mail.com common
- Merge all such possible, after merging sort based on emails


SOLUTION:
- Assign a index(row_number) for each account. This will get combined later
- Mantain a email<->owner dict called `parent_accounts`

FOR acc_id, emails in accounts:
    FOR email in emails:
        - if email not in parent_account => parent_accounts[email] = acc_id
        - else: means this email is already added into some other account
          Merge that and this account => ds.union(acc_id, parent_accounts[email])
          
-> After this you have the UF done, you have list of emails n its parent (unioned ones wont be here)
res = []
-> for email, parent in parent_accounts: # parent = idx (since owner names can be duplicates)
    cur_parent = uf.find_parent(parent) # safety since path compression might not have happened for all
    if cur_parent in res => res[cur_parent] = [email]
    else -> res[cur_parent].append(email)
    

-> Convert your parent_id into names and then sort emails based


ðŸ’¡Tricky Part: Since account names can be duplicates -> how do you differentiate 2 johns?
APPROACH 1
- Assign index to each acc_name and then you just keep on union these acc_indexes
- Maintain dict to check which email belongs to which acc_idx, then if its already seen UNION( current, seen_acc_idx)

APPROACH 2
- Consider unioning <email1, email2>. But store dict<email: acc_name>
- For each union first email with remanining ones. Iterate all emails -> find their parent and add to list 
- Then at last, replace parent email with its acc_name
