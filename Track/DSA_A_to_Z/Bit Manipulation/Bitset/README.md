# Bitset

ðŸ’¡ **IDEA**: 
- In many languages INT is at max 32 or 64 bit at max. 
- So consider each bit as number. 64 63 62 ... 5 4 3 2 1 0. Now in Python int is infinite so you can use it, but in other languages we have separate BITSET
- TC for operations = `N/32` or `N/64` based on the compiler


# 1. Subset Sum Queries
| Doing Subset sum once is easy, but if there any Q queries, you cant build the DP each time

ðŸ’¡ IDEA
- Each bit `i` represents if is subset sum of `i` possible
- 0000000001 - Subset sum of 0 is always possible hence 0th bit is always set

- Now, assume your arr = [2,4] # **SORTED ARRAY ONLY**
- `x` = cur_arr element
1. `x = 2` | bitset = `0000000001`
    - Now, all possible subset sums = x+(previously possible susbset sums = bits set as 1)
    - Ideally, you add
        1. bitset << x(2) = 0000000100
        2. bitset | bitset<<x(2) = 0000000101 ( Here now if you see 0th and 2nd bit is set -> Meaning 0,2 are possible sums)
    - THINK OF THIS AS: `bitset | bitset<<x` => Add `x` to each set bit after `x`.
        - Why this works? WE SORT THE ARRAY -> hence there will be no set bit before `x`
    - OUTPUT: bitset = `0000000101`
2. `x = 4` | bitset = `0000000101`
    - `0000000101` | `0001010000` = `0001010101`

**ðŸ’¡NOTE: WHY MASK MAYBE NEEDED**: 
- Here since we add `x` to every number on left of `x` we dont need a mask
- In some problems, you may want to add to only some bits on left, there you need BITMASK -> THEN OR with BITMASK

**OUTPUT**: 
9876543210
0001010101
- Possible subset sums = 0,2,4,6

3. CHECK IF SUBSET SUM: Just check of `query`th bit is set or not

```py

def subset_sum_queries(arr: list[int], queries: list[int]):
    # create subset sum
    bitset = 1
    for x in arr:
        bitset = (bitset | (bitset<<x))
    
    res = []
    for query in queries:
        res.append((
            query,
            bitset & (1<<query) != 0
        ))
    
    print(res)


arr = [1,2,3,5,10,12,15]
queries = [3, 10, 15, 50]

subset_sum_queries(arr, queries)

```


**STEPS SUMMARY**
- Each `i`th bit represents if sum of `i` is possible or not
- SORT THE ARRAY
- sum of 0 is always Possible -> bitset = 1
- Each element `x` -> `bitset` |= `bitset`<<`x`
    1. `bitset`<<`x` -> saying add `x` to all set bits after `x`th bit
    2. `bitset` |= `bitset`<<`x` -> older set bits + bits set after adding `x` to prev_sums


# 2. Maximum Total Reward
- **MAIN CHANGE**: 
    - In subset sum, you had to add `x` to every possible subset sum on right side
    - Here,  you need to add `x` to every sum on right side ( whether previously possible or not )
    
```py
"""
Maximal Total Reward: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-reward-using-operations-ii/description/


SOLUTION: Classic bitset
- What changes here from subset from?
    - There we add `x` to EVERY SET BIT (subset sum possible) on right: bitset |= bitset<<x
    - Here, you add `x` to every bit on right (whether set or not doesnt matter)
    - Why? If current reward `x` is greater than every thing on right, THEN YOU CAN ADD THOSE UP

class Solution:
    def maxTotalReward(self, rewardValues: List[int]) -> int:
        MAX_REWARD = 100001
        nums = sorted(rewardValues)
        n = len(nums)

        bitset = 1 # reward of 0 is always available
        for num in nums:
            # In normal subset sum => you want to add num to all on right 
            # Here, you want to make everything on right as set and then add num
            # why? if reward[x] is possible, then you can add any reward < x (everything on right)

            mask = (1<<num)-1 # set first num bits as 1
