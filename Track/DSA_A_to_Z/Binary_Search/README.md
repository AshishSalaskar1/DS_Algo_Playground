# Binary Search Refresher

### Problem Types 
1. **Base Variations** - Identify some trends to go left or right
2. **Binary Search on Answers**
3. **Third Array Generation Problems**:
    - This is variation of BS on Answers -> you are given 2 arrays `a`, `b` but are asked to find some answer in another array `c` which is formed by combination of `a` and `b` in some way
    - **Note**: You cant manually create the `c` array ( YOU WILL GET TLE or Mem Exceeded)
    - **Ex: Smallest K number in sum**
4. **Binary Search on every start**

## 1. Base Variations - Convert to 0s and 1s
- ðŸ’¡ Given any array -> **try to convert it to 0s and 1s and then it becomes searching for something in a 0,1 arrays**


### Example 1: Lower and upper bounds

1. **LOWER_BOUND** = first element in array **`>= x`** 
   - lower_bound(arr, target) =  ðŸ’¡**num elements < x**
2. **UPPER_BOUND** = first element in array **`> x`** *
   - upper_bound(arr, target) =  ðŸ’¡**num elements <= x**

### Example 2: Find how many times sorted array is rotated/shifted to right
- `[4,5,1,2,3]` -> this is rotated/shifted right 2 times  <br><br>  

1. `[4,5,1,2,3]` ==> `[0,0,1,1,1]`
    - `0` if `arr[i]>=arr[0]` else `1`
2. **Find the index of the right most 1 => ANSWER**
3. **Edge Case**: init `ans=0`, in case no rotations, all will be 0. You will never see ones, in that case ans=0 
- ðŸ’¡Here we consider unique elements, try solving issues when duplicate elments are allowed

### Example 3: Find peak in bitonic array
- `[1,4,5,6,7,10,6,4,2,1]` -> the peak=10

1. `[1,4,5,6,7,10,6,4,2,1]` => gets converted to<br>
   `[0,0,0,0,0, 1,1,1,1,1]`
    - `1` if `arr[i]>=arr[i+1]` else `0`
    - if `i==n-1` then `1`
2. **Find the index of the left most 1 => ANSWER**


ðŸ’¡**Notes**
- Since you do this directly to mid -> `convert(mid)` -> the TC remains O(logn)
- **This is what you internally do to decide whether to move left or right. Just that you are giving a 0-1 approach to this mental convesion** 
- **Dont focus on just that needed element, instead focus on pattern of numbers before and after**
