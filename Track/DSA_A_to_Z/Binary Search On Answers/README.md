💡 Tip:
1. Whenever you see “**maximize the minimum**” or “**minimize the maximum**,” think binary search on the answer.
2. Check if the condition is monotonic — here, if we can make the minimum power ≥ x, then we can also make it ≥ any smaller value.
- Use binary search on that monotonic range, and in the check function, apply greedy logic:
