# Adapter (Structural)

Ref: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter

Overview
- Converts one interface into another so that classes can work together that couldn't otherwise.
- Wraps an incompatible object and exposes a compatible API.

When to use
- You want to reuse a class that doesnâ€™t match the expected interface.
- Integrating a third-party or legacy component without changing its code.

How to identify
- A wrapper class translates calls from the target interface to the adaptee.

Pros
- Reuse existing code without modifying it.
- Isolates changes to integration logic.

Cons
- Extra layer of indirection.
- Too many adapters can complicate design.

Common confusions
- vs Decorator: Adapter changes interface; Decorator adds behavior but keeps interface.
- vs Proxy: Proxy controls access; Adapter converts interface.

Python example (adapting a legacy payment gateway)
```python
# Target interface expected by client
class PaymentGateway:
    def pay(self, amount: float) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError

# Adaptee: legacy API we can't modify
class LegacyPayAPI:
    def make_payment(self, pennies: int) -> None:
        print(f"[LegacyPayAPI] processed {pennies} pennies")

# Adapter maps target to adaptee
class LegacyPayAdapter(PaymentGateway):
    def __init__(self, adaptee: LegacyPayAPI) -> None:
        self._adaptee = adaptee

    def pay(self, amount: float) -> None:
        pennies = int(round(amount * 100))
        self._adaptee.make_payment(pennies)

# Client code uses target interface only
if __name__ == "__main__":
    gateway: PaymentGateway = LegacyPayAdapter(LegacyPayAPI())
    gateway.pay(12.34)
```

Quick glance
- Adapter = wrapper that converts interfaces.
- Keep client code unaware of the adaptee details.
