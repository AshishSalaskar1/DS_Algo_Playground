## Explanation of the Generative AI (GenAI) Part of the Code

### Key Components of the GenAI Flow:

### 1. Embedding and Language Model Initialization:
```python
embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model="llama3.2")
llm = ChatOllama(model="llama3.2")
```
- The code initializes an `OllamaEmbeddings` object and a `ChatOllama` object, both using the `llama3.2` model.
- `OllamaEmbeddings` is used for converting text into vector embeddings that can be used in similarity searches.
- `ChatOllama` is the language model that generates responses based on the input text and context.

### 2. Document Processing and Vector Store Creation:
```python
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
vector_db = Chroma.from_documents(splits, embeddings)
retriever = vector_db.as_retriever()
```
- The uploaded documents are split into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to ensure the documents are manageable for processing.
- A vector database (`Chroma`) is created using these document chunks, with embeddings generated by the `OllamaEmbeddings` object.
- The `retriever` object allows the model to query and retrieve the most relevant document chunks based on the user's questions.

### 3. Prompt Templates for Generative AI:
- **Context Q&A Prompt**:
```python
context_qna_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", prompt_text),
    MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
    ("human", "{input}")
])
```
  - This prompt helps in generating questions that could be asked based on the chat history and the user's current input. It reformulates the question to ensure it can be understood independently, without additional context.

- **Question Answering Prompt**:
```python
qna_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", system_prompt),
    MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
    ("human", "{input}")
])
```
  - This prompt is used by the assistant to answer questions. It provides instructions to the model to answer questions based on retrieved context and states that if an answer is not known, it should respond accordingly.

### 4. Chains for Combining Components:
- **History-Aware Retriever**:
```python
history_aware_retriever = create_history_aware_retriever(llm, retriever, context_qna_prompt)
```
  - This chain links the language model (`llm`) with the retriever and the context Q&A prompt. It manages context awareness to ensure the model generates relevant questions and considers chat history.

- **QA Chain**:
```python
qa_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, qna_prompt)
```
  - This chain connects the language model with the question-answering prompt and manages the integration of context during question answering.

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chain**:
```python
rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(history_aware_retriever, qa_chain)
```
  - This chain orchestrates the overall retrieval and response generation process by combining the `history_aware_retriever` and the `qa_chain`.

### 5. Runnable with Message History:
```python
conversational_rag_chain = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    rag_chain,
    get_session_history,
    input_messages_key="input",
    history_messages_key="chat_history",
    output_messages_key="answer"
)
```
- `RunnableWithMessageHistory` wraps the `rag_chain` to manage input and output messages and maintain chat history across interactions. The session history is retrieved and updated as the user interacts with the model.

### 6. User Interaction and Model Invocation:
```python
user_input = st.chat_input("Your question: ")
if user_input:
    response = conversational_rag_chain.invoke(
        {"input": user_input},
        config={"configurable": {"session_id": session_id}}
    )
```
- The user's input question is sent to the `conversational_rag_chain`, which calls the language model, retrieves relevant document contexts, and returns an answer.
- The `invoke` method uses the configured session ID for consistent history management.

### 7. Displaying and Storing Responses:
```python
assistant_response = response["answer"]
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    st.markdown(assistant_response)
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_response})
```
- The response from the language model is displayed in the chat, and the conversation history is updated with the assistant's answer.

### Summary:
This code leverages **LangChain's** capabilities to build a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** system, combining document retrieval, prompt generation, and language model interaction to create an AI-powered Q&A system. The approach ensures context-aware responses, where the model can access historical interactions and relevant document chunks to generate accurate answers.
